# Knight's Tour

*This project are my first steps in the world of building applications with React.*

This application will try to solve the challenge of completing the knight's tour from any position of the board.

> A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed; otherwise, it is open.

You can choose if you want to search for a open of closed tour!
After setting a start position you can monitor the moves by pressing `Continue` or `Step`.

Pressing `No monitoring` will solve the puzzle immediately and displays the result.

## About

I used Create React App to setup the initial code structure and Visual Studio Code to code the rest!

See the [Knight's tour page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour) on Wikipedia for more information.

## Setup

To run this application locally use must have the latest stable version of Node.js on your machine.
> During development this was v12.19.0.

### `npm install`
Download all the necessary packages.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
